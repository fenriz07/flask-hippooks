Description: 
        Authorize Sauce
        ===============
        
        The secret sauce for accessing the Authorize.net API. The Authorize APIs for
        transactions, recurring payments, and saved payments are all different and
        awkward to use directly. Instead, you can use Authorize Sauce, which unifies
        all three Authorize.net APIs into one coherent Pythonic interface. Charge
        credit cards, easily!
        
        ::
        
          >>> # Init the authorize client and a credit card
          >>> from authorize import AuthorizeClient, CreditCard
          >>> authorize = AuthorizeClient('285tUPuS', '58JKJ4T95uee75wd')
          >>> cc = CreditCard('4111111111111111', '2018', '01', '911', 'Joe', 'Blow')
          >>> card = client.card(cc)
        
          >>> # Charge a card
          >>> card.capture(100)
          <AuthorizeTransaction 2171829470>
        
          >>> # Save the card on Authorize servers for later
          >>> saved_card = card.save()
          >>> saved_card.uid
          '7713982|6743206'
        
          >>> # Use a saved card to auth a transaction, and settle later
          >>> saved_card = client.saved_card('7713982|6743206')
          >>> transaction = saved_card.auth(200)
          >>> transaction.settle()
